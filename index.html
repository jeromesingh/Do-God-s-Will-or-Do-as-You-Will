  <p class="bible">Romans 6:23 KJV  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

  </p>

  <p class="bible">1 John 3:4 KJV  Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.

</p>

  <p class="bible" >James 2:8-12 KJV  If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do
  well:  (9)  But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.  (10)  For
  whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.  (11)  For he that said, Do not
  commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a
  transgressor of the law.  (12)  So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 1:21 KJV  And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from
their sins.

</p>

<p class="bible">2 Corinthians 5:19 KJV  To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their
trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

  </p>

<p class="bible" >2 Corinthians 5:21 KJV  For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness
of God in him.

</p>

<p class="bible">John 5:14 KJV  Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more,
lest a worse thing come unto thee.

</p>

<p class="bible">Galatians 2:14-17 KJV  But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto
Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest
thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?  (15)  We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,  (16) 
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in
Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of
the law shall no flesh be justified.  (17)  But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found
sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 7:7-13 KJV  What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I
had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.  (8)  But sin, taking occasion by the commandment,
wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.  (9)  For I was alive without the law once:
but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.  (10)  And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found
to be unto death.  (11)  For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.  (12)  Wherefore
the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.  (13)  Was then that which is good made death unto me?
God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment
might become exceeding sinful.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Peter 1:16 KJV  Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.

</p>

<p class="bible">Revelation 15:3-4 KJV  And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and
marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.  (4)  Who shall not fear
thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy
judgments are made manifest.

</p>

<p class="bible">Psalms 25:8 KJV  Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.

</p>

<p class="bible">Psalms 40:6-8 KJV  Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin
offering hast thou not required.  (7)  Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,  (8)  I
delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.

</p>

</p>

shall be in danger of the judgment:

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 5:27 KJV  Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:

</p>

<p class="bible">Ephesians 2:14-15 KJV  For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition
between us;  (15)  Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for
to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;

</p>

<p class="bible">Exodus 12:43 KJV  And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger
eat thereof:

</p>

<p class="text"></p> <b>What are these ordinances?</b>

<p class="bible">1 Corinthians 5:7 KJV  Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even
Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:

</p>

<p class="bible">Exodus 31:18 KJV  And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of
testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.

</p>

<p class="bible">Deuteronomy 10:2 KJV  And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and
thou shalt put them in the ark.

they were finished,

</p>

offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every
thing upon his day:  (38)  Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside
all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.

</p>

<p class="bible">Acts 15:24 KJV  Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting
your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:

</p>

<p class="bible">Acts 15:4-5 KJV  And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders,
and they declared all things that God had done with them.  (5)  But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees
which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.

</p>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 10:1 KJV  For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never
with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.

</p>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 10:3 KJV  But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.

</p>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 10:6-9 KJV  In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.  (7)  Then said I, Lo, I come
(in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.  (8)  Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering
and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the
law;  (9)  Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
